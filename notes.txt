BDD
===========================================================
What is BDD? : This is a development method which has evolved from the Test-driven development process. Behavior Driven development is mostly about technical insight and business knowledge.

Why use BDD Framework?
Before the BDD framework, everyone was using TDD. TDD works fine in software development, provided the stakeholders are familiar with the framework being used and their technical knowledge is sufficient. However, this may not be the case always.
BDD provides a path that acts as a bridge to overcome the gap between the technical and the non-technical teams because the test cases are commonly written in simple text, i.e. English. The main advantage of BDD is the plain and clearer approach which is easier to understand.
BDD Format to write test case: 
Given – When – Then Approach
• Given: Some given context (Preconditions).
• When: Some Action is performed (Actions).
• Then: Particular outcome/consequence after the above step (Results).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Where this test case written?: in a Feature File
Example of  Feature File:
Feature: Login function of Gmail Application

Scenario: As a valid user I should able to Login to G-mail 

Given User is navigating to G-mail Login Page
When User need to enter username as "Username" and password as "Password"
Then User is successfully navigated to the G-mail Mail Box



Docker
===========================================================
What is a container: 
    Layers of images(alpine 3.10 linux base image)
    A way to package application with all the necessary dependenciew and configuration.
    Portable artifact, easly shared and moved around.
    Mkaes development and deployment more efficient.


Before containers
    developers needs to install all software and services in their respective OS
After containers
    Own isolated environment
    packaged with all needed configuration

docker ps or docker ps -a(history)
docker pull postgres:9.6
docker images
docker run image_name
docker start container_id
docker stop container_id
docker run -p6000:6379 -d image_name  
docker logs container_id or docker logs name
docker run -p6000:6379 -d --name new_name image_name
docker exec -it container_id /bin/bash or docker exec -it name /bin/bash
